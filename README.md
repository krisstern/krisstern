# Hello, world!
I’m Kris Stern. I am currently engaged in video analytics engineering work. I maintain a Medium blog for work at https://krisstern.medium.com/.

I started volunteering for the Jenkins project in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Special Interest Group. [A short bio](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/krisstern/) at the Jenkins site.
