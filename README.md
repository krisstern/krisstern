# Hello, world!
I’m Kris Stern, with a PhD in Physics/Astrophysics from the University of Hong Kong (HKU). I am a software engineer based in Hong Kong. I maintain a Medium blog at https://krisstern.medium.com/.

I started volunteering for the Jenkins project, most notably in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Special Interest Group in January 2022. Here is [my short bio](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/krisstern/) at the Jenkins site.

I have also adopted the Jenkins [Build Timeout Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/build-timeout-plugin) as a maintainer as of February 2022 and the Jenkins [GitLab Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-plugin) as a maintainer as of January 2023. 

As of August 2022, I have also started a side project to satisfy my interest in modern physics called the "Physics Vault". More details can be found at the GitHub Pages site at [https://physics-vault.github.io/](https://physics-vault.github.io/). This focuses primarily on my journey as I work through some undergraduate/graduate level textbooks on modern physics, including the problem sets.
