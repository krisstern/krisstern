# Hello, world!
I’m Kris Stern, with a PhD in Physics from the University of Hong Kong (HKU). I am a software engineer based in Hong Kong. I maintain a Medium blog at https://krisstern.medium.com/.

I started volunteering for the Jenkins project in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Special Interest Group in January 2022. Here is [my short bio](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/krisstern/) at the Jenkins site.

I have also adopted the Jenkins [Build Timeout Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/build-timeout-plugin) as a maintainer as of February 2022.
