# Hello, world!
I’m Kris Stern, with a PhD in Physics/Astrophysics from the University of Hong Kong (HKU). I am professionally a Software Engineer based in Hong Kong. <!--I maintain a Medium blog at https://krisstern.medium.com/. -->

I started volunteering for the Jenkins project, most notably in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Special Interest Group since January 2022. 
I am an org admin for the Google Summer of Code (GSoc) program at Jenkins since 2021, and have either lead mentored or co-mentored numerous projects successfully since I started mentoring. 
I have also adopted the Jenkins [Build Timeout Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/build-timeout-plugin) as a maintainer as of February 2022, the Jenkins [GitLab Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-plugin) as a maintainer as of January 2023, the Jenkins [GitLab OAuth Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-oauth-plugin) as a maintainer as of April 2023, and the Jenkins [Docker Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-plugin) as a maintainer as of September 2023. I have also become a Jenkins [Bill of Materials (BOM) for Jenkins Plugins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/bom) maintainer to faciliate their weekly releases on occasion since September 2023. I was made a member of the Jenkins Release Team as of October 2023, and I have contributed as a new point LTS Release Lead on occasion since sometime before that. 

I am a CI/CD Cybersecurity SIG member as of January 2025: [CI/CD Cybersecurity SIG Overview](https://github.com/cdfoundation/CICD-Cybersecurity/blob/main/README.md).

<!-- As of August 2022, I have also started a side project to satisfy my interest in modern physics called the "Physics Vault". More details can be found at the GitHub Pages site at [https://physics-vault.github.io/](https://physics-vault.github.io/). This focuses primarily on my journey as I work through some undergraduate/graduate level textbooks on modern physics, including the problem sets. -->

I have an account on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/). You are welcome to follow me at https://mastodon.social/@krisstern where I occasionally share my software engineering escapades there.
